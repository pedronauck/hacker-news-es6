## Hacker News ES6
Just a simple Hacker News Feed built using these ES6 features:

- Modules
- Classes
- Template Literals
- Let (Block scoping)
- Arrow Functions

##### Demo [here](http://pedronauck.github.io/hacker-news-es6)!

To be able to use ES6 today, I'm using [6to5](https://github.com/sebmck/6to5) transpiler with [Browserify](browserify.org). It's pretty simple, but is not native yet. So, I don't advise to use that in production ;)

## Usage

If you can see the application working run:

```bash
npm install
gulp
```
